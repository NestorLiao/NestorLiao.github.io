*Recommended. 1 Online Time*:  
   - *2 to 3 hours per day* for research, troubleshooting, and engaging with online communities like Stack Overflow or GitHub. This includes watching tutorials, participating in forums, and downloading relevant coding resources.
   - The rest of your study time can be spent offline, coding on your own, reading textbooks, or working through problems. This minimizes distractions while maximizing focus on the learning process.

2. *Offline Coding and Study*:
   - *4 to 6 hours per day* of uninterrupted coding and reading, with breaks for rest and mental clarity.
   - Focus on solving real-world problems, building projects, and applying theoretical knowledge. You can study books and manuals offline and code in your offline environment without the constant distraction of online interactions.

3. *Long-Term Learning Plan* (3-6 months):
   - *Weekdays*: Devote time to specific learning goals such as mastering data structures, algorithms, or system programming.
     - *Example schedule*: 3 hours of online study for tutorials/documentation + 4-6 hours of focused offline coding practice.
   - *Weekends*: Focus on larger projects or tackling more challenging tasks (possibly with the help of online resources as needed).
     - *Example weekend schedule*: Limit online time to 2 hours for research or collaboration, focus the rest of the weekend on hands-on project development.

4. *Minimizing Distractions*:
   - Try to *disconnect from social media* or news sites to keep your mental energy focused on learning.
   - Consider blocking distracting websites or using "focus" tools to restrict internet access during study periods.

5. *Mental Health and Breaks*:
   - Ensure you *take regular breaks* (every hour or so) to avoid burnout.
   - Engage in *offline hobbies* like walking or reading to recharge your brain.

By following this structured approach, youâ€™ll likely be able to balance your online time effectively while maintaining your programming goals and mental well-being. 

As a reference, studies suggest that avoiding excessive screen time can help preserve focus and prevent burnout, especially when you're working intensively on complex subjects.


* So my solution to this:
only turn on network in sat-fri during 12am to 15am: three hous online peroid
only turn on network in weekend during 12am to 13am: one hou online peroid
block porn/news/3s/entertainment sites, or any search engine on hosts and router level and ublock origin, and tell ai search engine don't talk about anything no relavent to programming.

Then you goona not only value the online time without brainless browse sites, the rest time you will experien the mindful moment though:
meditation
walk outside
kettlebell
programming
chat with people
cooking or learn new skill
