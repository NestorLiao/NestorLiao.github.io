*** TODO how to emacs overlay in nixos to config not to have somepackage natively exclude
how to disable gomoku, I am getting addiction to that game...
*** TODO using consult-gh-notifications, and I just type wrong pass as my own pc's pass, not github token
it used to pop a dialog box at first time, then I input my linux user's password, then it just disappered.
why? I want to reinput, but it just no dialog anymore and it just show me:
ghub--handle-response-error: HTTP Error: 403, "Forbidden", "https://api.github.com/graphql", ((message . "Request forbidden by administrative rules.

*** TODO package leego elisp package as emacs package
- description: do leetcode in emacs with leetgo
- require: wget/pandoc/leetgo/
- wget for fetch image
- pandoc for markdown to org
- leetgo for pick/commit questions
- simple init, use leetgo
- batch fetch, (leetcode-fetch-batch "1 2 3") to fetch 1/2/3 questions
- also you can fetch contest,
- auto detected browser cookie, no need to fill cookies by yourself
- offline test, use pre fetched testcase/makefile/awk to local test tasks.
- org format, local image, and generally you can easily export all questions.
- wait I finished doing leetcode
*** FIXME How to modify org-mode's #+INCLUDE:                :pr:mailinglist:
**** how to contribute to org
https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contribute.html
https://orgmode.org/worg/org-mailing-list.html
**** explain FR
**Subject:** [FR] Add support for reverse (negative) line ranges in `#+INCLUDE:` `:lines`

Hi all,

Org’s current `#+INCLUDE:` keyword supports selecting lines using the `:lines` parameter, e.g.:

- `5-10` — lines 5 to 10
- `-10` — lines 1 to 10
- `10-` — line 10 to EOF

However, Org currently does **not** support selecting lines counted from the end of the file.

I would like to propose extending the syntax to support “reverse line numbers”, similar to how many tools allow negative indexing. Examples:

#+begin_example
#+INCLUDE: "x.txt" :lines "~5-"      ; last 5 lines to EOF
#+INCLUDE: "x.txt" :lines "~5-~1"   ; last 5 lines to last 1 line
#+INCLUDE: "x.txt" :lines "-~5"     ; from beginning to last 5 lines
#+INCLUDE: "x.txt" :lines "10-~1"   ; from line 10 to last 1 line
#+end_example

This would make it much easier to include “the last N lines” of logs, datasets, generated files, etc., without needing to preprocess the file externally.

If there is interest, I would be happy to help test or contribute patches.

Thanks!

*** FIXME pyim % 字符触发 Not enough arguments for format string
使用虎码码表https://github.com/welandx/huma-danzi.pyim，同样使用其readme中的配置

fix the columndeeply/hosts 's 127.0.0.0 to 0.0.0.0

by clone and compare the problem is that "I include a lost non-porn site in to it".
not just "non-porn" sites, I also get a lot cdn server to block, which fetch from a lot of m3u8 streaming server. it may also block some movies which using the same server as porn sites...
so, there is only KLUDGE for thing like blocking porn site, first question: what is porn? really?
to be, the social media like twitter which spread sexual clip? the pornhub teaching mathmatic? the reddit/4chan/zhihu/weibo/... even the taobao can sell sex toys with sexual pictures, so blocking internet is blocking porn really? I don't know, it's a question for everyone.

get uniq hosts, and update to github. it's I only get 23240 unique lines.

add 17868 new hosts

Used to maintain my hostslist, write a tempermonkey script with ublacklist addon to block chinese keyword search result automatically.

mainly it blocked sexual model gallary sites/Pirate JAV/and chinese porn m3u8 CDN which I filter from a github m3u8 collection repos/or anything non-programming like socialmedia/news/shopping..., occationally the script blocks org/edu/gov sites too.

I remove duplicate hosts in yours and delete non-porn sites, but there still too many which I can't checkout they all.

BTW, I didn't update my hostslist for a long time, because I just find blocking search engine and "hot" social-media instead porn sites is way more easier, I now use tavily/chatgpt/github in emacs only.

BTW, seems like use 0.0.0.0 instaed of 127.0.0.1 is faster.

Thanks for this. I'm encouraged that you looked at other monochrome themes and went with a comprehensive approach here.

Typically themes are not byte compiled but you still want to maintain conventions across these "stub" files -
